# yolo

Manage infrastructure and services on AWS for multiple accounts/stages.

(Or, "yolo everything into prod.")

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/yolocli/badge/?version=latest)](http://yolocli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Docs

Detailed documentation is available at https://yolocli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Terminology

 * __Project:__ a collection of services, the code repository represents a project.
 * __Service:__ typically a microservice, could be an API Gateway/Lambda powered API, or a CloudFront-based web UI. A project may contain multiple services.
 * __Account:__ an AWS account, in some contexts it also means a baseline [infrastructure].
 * __Stage:__ an instance of the project deployed to an account. There may be multiple stages within an account. Examples of stages are "dev", "test", "QA", "production", etc.

## Docker build container for Lambda Functions

The `Dockerfile` contained in this repo is published to
https://hub.docker.com/r/larsbutler/yolo/. It is built directly from GitHub, so
if this file is updated the patch needs to merged downstream into the master
branch of https://github.com/larsbutler/yolo.

## Workflow

 0. Authenticate with "Fanatical Support for AWS" (using Rackspace Cloud credentials), so that AWS account credentials can be fetched when needed, without having to re-authenticate:

```
yolo login
```

 1. Create a Yolo file, you can find [an example](https://github.com/rackerlabs/yolo/blob/master/yolo-example.yaml) in the code repository.
 2. Define AWS account-level resources using a CloudFormation template.
 3. Deploy the baseline infrastructure:

```
yolo deploy-infra --account testaccount
```

 4. Define stage-level resources using a different CloudFormation template. There can be multiple stages within a single account (they will be deployed as separate CloudFormation stacks), and a stage represents an instance of your project (collection of services).
 5. Deploy the stage-level infrastructure:

```
yolo deploy-infra --stage dev
```

 6. Depending on the type of application you're developing, you can finally build and/or deploy it:

```
yolo build-lambda --stage dev
yolo deploy-lambda --stage dev
```

## Publishing to PyPI

NOTE(larsbutler): This is more for my benefit than anyone else's, since I can
never remember the exact incantations to publish to PyPI for some reason. :)

Preparing a release:

- Choose a new version number
- Update `yolo.__version__` in `yolo/__init__.py`
- Update the CHANGELOG.md with any relevant changes, adding a new section for
  the new version number
- Submit a pull request with those boilerplate changes
- Merge it to `master`

Build the release:

    $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine
    $ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

Test the release:

    $ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
    $ python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ yolo

Make the actual release:

    $ twine upload dist/*

Tag the release:

    $ git tag VERSION $(git rev-parse HEAD)  # where 'VERSION' is the new version number
    $ git push REMOTE --tags  # where REMOTE is origin, upstream, etc.
